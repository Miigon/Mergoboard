1. fix trrs connector bug (rev0 incorrectly connected vcc to sleeve)
2. move B+ and B- pads out so that mcu sockets could be thinner
3. trrs connector footprint stabilizers should be 1.2 instead of 1.5
4. move mounting holes around to avoid obstructing switches
5. (maybe) use another mcu footprint that uses jumpers to support flipping
6. change the battery power switch so both halves are all on or off when the switch is in the same position
	(currently it results in one being on and another being off, which is confusing )
7. shrink the mounting holes a little bit (currently way larger than a M3 screw could ever need.)
8. make reset switch flippable so it's on the top side of the board on both hands. (or bottom for a cleaner look?) 
9. carry RAW instead of VCC through TRRS cable
